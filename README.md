# Advent of Code

These are my solutions. A lot of them are pretty terrible since they were written as quickly as
possible!

## Requirements

- Bash (I used v5) or compatible shell
- Java 21
- Julia 1.6.7 LTS, with extra packages:
    - `Combinatorics`
    - `GeneralizedCRT`
    - `Memoization`
    - `Multibreak`
    - `PyCall`
- Kotlin 1.9
- Maven (handles Java & Kotlin dependencies)
- Python 3 (tested 3.7 & 3.11), with extra packages:
    - `requests`
    - `z3-solver`

I use a different primary language for each year, so not everything is required for all modules.
I usually try to solve the first problem of the year in Bash, though.
