# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

These are my solutions. A lot of them are pretty terrible since they were written as quickly as
possible!

## Requirements

- Bash or compatible shell
- Java 21
- Kotlin (1.8 and 1.9 should work, maybe others)
- Maven
- Python 3, with extra packages:
    - `requests`
    - `z3-solver`

I use a different primary language for all years, so not everything is required for all modules.
I do try to solve the first problem of the year in Bash, though.
